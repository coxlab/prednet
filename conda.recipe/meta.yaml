# If editing this file, beware that conda build can produce some inscrutable errors.
# For example, if you replace setup_py_data.get('license') with setup_py.get('license')
# (representing a misspelling of a variable name you might want to add),
# conda buidl will vomit forth TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not callable,
# with no hint as to what NoneType object is being called or where or when or why.

  summary: Code and models accompanying Deep Predictive Coding Networks for Video Prediction and Unsupervised Learning by Bill Lotter, Gabriel Kreiman, and David Cox. The PredNet is a deep recurrent convolutional neural network that is inspired by the neuroscience concept of predictive coding (Rao and Ballard, 1999; Friston, 2005).
